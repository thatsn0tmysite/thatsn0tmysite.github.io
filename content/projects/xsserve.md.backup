I promise I will revise this page with a decent description of the project, a roadmap, possibly some documentation and stuff. For now, here is the bare bone README.md copy pasted for your own convenience.

XSServe is ~~a shameless copy of~~ heavely inspired by the [XSSHunter](https://xsshunter.com) by ([@IAmMandatory](https://twitter.com/IAmMandatory))  project, rewritten in Go.

## ‚ö† Disclaimer
The project is in a VERY bare bone state right now, so if you want a prime experience, use other tools.

> NOTE: there is no authentication to the UI.

## üèÅ Goals
The initial goal is to allow users to use the same service, but in a self-contained way for lazy penetration testers, like myself.
Currently I am using MongoDB as a backend, but I'd really love a serverless nosql database as a default option. I wasn't able to find any.

The final goal is still unclear as the project might evolve as different needs arise. 


## üëã Contributing
Currently I'd love some help with:

- UI/UX: in case it wasn't obvious by the look of it, the UI is pretty ugly. I wouldn't mind a skilled UI designer to do a nice looking interface to ease the usage and look... well... good.
- Developers: I am currently working on this project as I learn Go, in the little free time I have, I am by no means a developer so any advice is appreciated, without overly complicating the project.
- Logo: cause every cool project has a logo.
