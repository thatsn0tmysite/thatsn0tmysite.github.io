Torget, or `tget` for short, is a http(s) file downloader for Tor made by [thatsn0tmysite](https://thatsn0tmy.site) (a.k.a. n0tme).

Where `tget` "shines" over other tools is its (ab)use of bandwith, it spawns multiple Tor instances, it allows downloads of multiple files over multiple Tor clients, avoiding saturating the bandwith with concurrent downloads.
This allows for faster parallel downloads and a more total (theorical) bandwith.

Not the most novel (nor elegant) technique but... meh.

This tool makes use of the handy [bine](https://github.com/cretz/bine) and the fancy [mpb](https://github.com/vbauerster/mpb) libraries!

If you find this **obnoxious thing** useful leave me a star, fork and contribute, also consider [donating to Tor](https://donate.torproject.org/)!

- [x] Onion themed logo
- [ ] Refactor code out of `cmd/root.go` (**SOME** code refactored)
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Insert fancy benchmark comparison gif to readme

## Build
To build simply `git clone` this repo and run this from torget's folder:
```bash
mkdir bin
go build -o bin/tget
```
