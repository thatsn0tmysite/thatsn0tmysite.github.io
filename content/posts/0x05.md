Hi folks!
I recently read about a [few vulnerabilities](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/critical-bugs-in-terramaster-tos-could.html) on Terramaster which were ~~basically stolen from me~~ heavily inspired by my previous ones, so I decided to look into Terramaster again, just to find a few more. Ah.

This time I didn't spend much time reasearching, and I couldn't find an auth bypass so you will need valid credentials to reach the RCEs. Don't worry tho, you ransomware operators can still get the admin hashes and username. Some ~~assembly~~ hashcat required.

Speaking of ransomware,about the impact the last exploit I published got on the devices, I am sorry for everyone who got their stuff locked by deadbolt. I tried to get in touch with Terramaster, they never replied to me.

Yet, I persisted and this time I made another attempt at getting in touch with the developers - once more I got ghosted.

As always, if in a hurry, just get the exploit code form [here](https://gist.github.com/thatsn0tmysite/fca704a47248722590ccd9cc6304cb75).

## The menu
On today's menu we have:
- 4 new flavours of RCEs
- 8 flavours of XSS
- 1 double blind SQLi
- 1 info disclosure

but before moving to the juicy parts, let's start from the beginning, again.

## Decrypt
This time the developers put a litte more effort (very little) into encrypting their PHP files. 
Also, cracking it, made me feel like a terrible person: the key literally asked me to stop poking around their product. **I do have a heart, I swear...**

After me and [bloodyshell](https://matrix.to/#/@bloodyshell:matrix.org) found out about the update, before I could even download the file, [bloodyshell](https://matrix.to/#/@bloodyshell:matrix.org) already reversed the key generation algorithm.

```
It's not easy to develop software,please don't crack it please keep it secret
```

And they are absolutely right, it is not easy to develop software, but that is not an excuse to not perform security audits or accurate code review. I hope I will eventually reach out to the developers to explain this better.

Anyway, this time the key itself was begging me not to crack their code again. I obviously couldn't resist (**...or maybe I don't, after all.**):
```c
void FUN_001016b0(long param_1)
{
  ulong uVar1;
  char cVar2;
  
  uVar1 = 0;
  do {
    if ((uVar1 & 1) == 0) {
      cVar2 = s_It's0not2easy3to4develop6softwar_001143b0[uVar1];
    }
    else {
      cVar2 = s_It's0not2easy3to4develop6softwar_001143b0[uVar1 * 2];
    }
    *(char *)(param_1 + uVar1) = cVar2;
    uVar1 = uVar1 + 1;
  } while (uVar1 != 0x20);
  return;
}
```

To rebuild the key, just do the same as above with some python:
```python3
>>> s="""It's0not2easy3to4develop6software,5please7don't9crack8it6please9keep7it3secretIt's0not2easy3to4develop6software,5please7don't9crack8it6please9keep7it3secret"It's0not2easy3to4develop6software,5please7don't9crack8it6please9keep7it3secretIt's0not2easy3to4develop6software,5please7don't9crack8it6please9keep7it3sec
ret"""
>>> len(s)
313
>>> ''.join([s[i] if (i % 2) == 0 else s[i*2] for i in range(32)])
"I''o0aot2eaoyota45eaedot6aoitlae"
```

Conclusion? Even after I **highly suggested** not to focus on protecting the PHP code from view, but on securing its bugs first, no real patch was addressed for the RCEs which still appear to be there.

Anyway, the new key is: `I''o0aot2eaoyota45eaedot6aoitlae`. You can reuse the [unscrew script](https://gist.github.com/thatsn0tmysite/c20602289d2cdc9ab7484851eefd92ba) from last time. Just change the key.

Security through obscurity is never a good idea. Sorry guys.

Also I noticed that the whole UI is taken from this GPLv3 licensed application: [github.com/kalcaddle/KodExplorer](https://github.com/kalcaddle/KodExplorer) and somebody forgot to include it in their open source licensed softwares (or I couldn't find it from a quick glance in their provided source files):
```
https://www.terra-master.com/us/gplsource/
```

## Vulns, vulns everywhere.
### Still too much info, pal.
Since the old APIs are now "protected" from unauthorized users, I had to find a new information disclosure.
To achieve this we simply send any malformed request to:
```
http://nas.ip:8181/v1/SessionEvents/update
```

This time we only get back a couple information about PHP, the webserver and... the username of the `admin` user. 

- ~~Get admin user~~ DONE.

Also, it is worthy to notice that the update procedure does not seem to delete old files, after upgrading I still had the `m1.php` and `m2.php` files. 
This still leaves the app vulnerable to the MAC address disclosure discussed in the [previous blogpost](https://thatsn0tmy.site/posts/2021/12/how-to-summon-rces/).

### SQLi
Since this time we didn't get the admin hash back, I looked for other ways to get it.
Turns out one can just get the password hash from the database using a double blind SQLi in the login form. **Unauthenticated**. So old school.

The vulnerable parameter is the `name` field in the query string inside the `user.class.php::loginSubmit` function. 

I optimized the sqlmap command as much as I could, modify as needed:
```bash
sqlmap -u "http://nas.ip/tos/index.php?user/loginSubmit&name=sqli&password=n0t&platform=me" --dbms=sqlite --level=5 --risk=2 --technique=t -p name -T user_table -C password --dump --time-sec {args.sqlmap_time} --where "username=$(printf $ADMIN | base64)"
```

Obviously replace `$ADMIN` with the username of the administrator from the previous step.

This takes a little time, but not too long, so go grab a coffee and wait ~~for the new ransomware wave~~. This joke is not as funny now that it actually happened - is it? You can't say I did not warn you though.

- ~~Get the admin hash~~ DONE.

### RCEs
As usual, it has not been very difficult to pwn TOS, using the [previously mentioned technique](https://thatsn0tmy.site/posts/2021/12/how-to-summon-rces/) of grepping for `shell`.

As for the RCEs, same ol'story, user input **still** doesn't get validated in many places, or gets validated poorly (seriously, get a [hint](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellcmd.php) or [two](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php)).

They are all pretty obvious in the exploit.

- ~~PWN~~ DONE.

### XSS galore
Basically all parameters used in these pages are vulnerable, in case you needed a reminder that `echo $_GET['whatever'];` is always a bad idea:
 
```
http://nas.ip:8181/3.0/template/share/edit.php?user=%22%20onerror=alert(1)%3Ealert(1);//%3C/script%3E

```

### Misc
After the main dish, if you are interested there are a few more gotchas:

- All downloads from the store happen over HTTP, not HTTPS. A random example is: `http://dl.terra-master.com/cn/RTK7.0CJ/Tomcat_TOS_APP_1.2.1_aarch64.tpk`
- I could count at least one more hardcoded key in the application, which is found in the Mcrypt class: `a!takA:dlmcldEv,e`. Used when Mcrypt gets called without a key parameter.
- I found a couple path traversal, but I was too lazy to see if they could be properly weaponized, notes are below, enjoy:

## Destroy
Once again, we can chain some of the vulnerabilities to get to an RCE, sadly this time it requires a tiny bit of effort.

We first run the script to get a user's hash, then crack it with your favorite cracking too, finally launch the script again giving the hash and credentials. 

By default the script attempts to grab the admin's hash if no user is specified. Enjoy:

## Goodbye, my friends
I guess I will now take a break from breaking Terramaster (put intended), it stopped being fun - at least for now. It's basically a metasploitable, but you pay for it.

As for the remediations, this time you really can't do much other than wait for a patch and use strong passwords.
Protip for terramaster: if researchers try to get in touch with you via twitter and via your support mail and your support chat, do not ignore them :).

As a side note, if any "researcher" uses my work it'd be cool if y'all at least mentioned me. Just saying.
