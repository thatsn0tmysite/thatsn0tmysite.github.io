For the few souls that ever followed my blog. I finally migrated. 
There was no real reason to keep a [wordpress blog](https://thatsn0tmysite.wordpress.com), as I really never used any features from Wordpress.

I migrated to Github pages, because... free hosting, and custom domains. Seemed nice enough to me, also for some reason I ended up using Hugo, over Jekyll. I could never get Jekyll to run even thought the setup is actually almsot the same as Hugo's.

Truth is, deep inside my brain there is a gopher lurking.

Well, this was only a first post, I do not really have anything else to share. As always I end up writing once or less a year.

Hopefully having migrated to github pages will push me to write more.

Before fading to radio silence again, I will leave you with a question that has been hunting me lately.
Do people really read reports from [openbugbounty](https://openbugbounty.org/), I reported several XSS issues since December, and they haven't been fixed yet, nothing exciting, just the usual suspect: `"><script>alert(1)</script>`.

In a few days the reports are going to be disclosed...
Until then, cheers!


Oh, by the way,
