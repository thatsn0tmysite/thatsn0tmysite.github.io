      <description>Well, hello there! Last few weeks have been a little busy between my mere analog life and pwning industrial ovens work. Lately I have been banging my head against this thing known as Windows.
It&amp;rsquo;s APIs to be precise, as I am trying to move out of my comfort zone of &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; (I am by no means a developer, but when I make stuff, it&amp;rsquo;s usually on Linux).
As a side note, while we&amp;rsquo;re talking about development, I recently decided to produce a rip-off of the amazing xsshunter and write it in Go.</description>

      <description>The title is kind of a very bad pun, one of the &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s not even funny&amp;rdquo; ones. So, what is today&amp;rsquo;s post about? Google.
No, not the privacy concerns or the data usage policies, nor their silly Google Play Store rules. Not the tracking, not the fact that their products seem to be walking dead bodies before they reach their prime time (looking at you Stadia)&amp;hellip; but books.
I recently decided to download back all the e-books which I so carefully uploaded over the year to their Books service back&amp;hellip;</description>
