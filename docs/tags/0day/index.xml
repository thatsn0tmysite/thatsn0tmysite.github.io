      <description>Hi folks! I recently read about a few vulnerabilities on Terramaster which were basically stolen from me heavily inspired by my previous ones, so I decided to look into Terramaster again, just to find a few more. Ah.
This time I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend much time reasearching, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find an auth bypass so you will need valid credentials to reach the RCEs. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry tho, you ransomware operators can still get the admin hashes and username.</description>

In the last couple weeks I was waiting for ZDI to know if they were interested in giving me some cash for this, but unfortunately they were not, so here you go: a freshly spawned 0day - merry fucking XMAS.</description>
