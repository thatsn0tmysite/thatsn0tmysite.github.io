      <description>For the few souls that ever followed my blog. I finally migrated. There was no real reason to keep a wordpress blog, as I really never used any features from Wordpress.
I migrated to Github pages, because&amp;hellip; free hosting, and custom domains. Seemed nice enough to me, also for some reason I ended up using Hugo, over Jekyll. I could never get Jekyll to run even thought the setup is actually almsot the same as Hugo&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
