Well, as mentioned in the last [post](/posts/2021/03/first-commit/) some lame XSS I found just went public.

For those wanting to jump straight to the point:
 - [muoversiaroma.it](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1610312/)
 - [romamobile.it](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1610327/)
 - [travel.mob.cotralspa.it](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1610334/)
 - [servizi.cotralspa.it](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/1610344/)
 
I am a firm believer in the philosophy of "disclose as you please", for the vulnerabilities above, I decided to attempt and be as ethical as possible and tried to disclose them responsibly.

That attempt failed.

Apparently what a researcher thinks is going to happen and what actually happens not always matches. Actually, almost never does in my experience.

I used [openbugbounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org) because, in all honestly, I  have no desire in time juggling myself through finding security contacts, emailing and explaining things, so if I can just break things, and have the rest happen auto-magically, so be it... or to put it differently, I'm a lazy bum and I just don't give a flying fu*k (hell, it's my blog, why do I censure myself, fuck, I meant **FUCK** - sorry kids).

Well long story short: those vulnerabilities are still unpatched to this day and I am kind of bored, so... blogpost.

If anyone from [@InfoAtac](https://twitter.com/InfoAtac), [@BusCotral](https://twitter.com/BusCotral) or [@romamobilita](https://twitter.com/romamobilita) happens to read this blog post, maybe, just maybe, fix them? I'm sure your users would appreciate it.
Also, consider using a [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/), or making it easier to find security contacts.

By the way, public disclosures are a free as in beer service, however, rewards are still appreciated :).
  
Until next time, 
pop alerts.
