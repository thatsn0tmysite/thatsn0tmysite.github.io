            <description>Well, as mentioned in the last post, some lame XSS I found just went public.
For those wanting to jump straight to the point:
 muoversiaroma.it romamobile.it travel.mob.cotralspa.it servizi.cotralspa.it  I am a firm believer in the philosophy of &amp;ldquo;disclose as you please&amp;rdquo;, for the vulnerabilities above, I decided to attempt and be as ethical as possible and tried to disclose them responsibly.
That attempt failed.
Apparently what a researcher thinks is going to happen and what actually happens not always matches.</description>

<p>For those wanting to jump straight to the point:</p>

</ul>
<p>I am a firm believer in the philosophy of &ldquo;disclose as you please&rdquo;, for the vulnerabilities above, I decided to attempt and be as ethical as possible and tried to disclose them responsibly.</p>
<p>That attempt failed.</p>
<p>Apparently what a researcher thinks is going to happen and what actually happens not always matches. Actually, almost never does in my experience.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.openbugbounty.org">openbugbounty</a> because, in all honestly, I  have no desire in time juggling myself through finding security contacts, emailing and explaining things, so if I can just break things, and have the rest happen auto-magically, so be it&hellip; or to put it differently, I&rsquo;m a lazy bum and I just don&rsquo;t give a flying fu*k (hell, it&rsquo;s my blog, why do I censure myself, fuck, I meant <strong>FUCK</strong> - sorry kids).</p>
<p>Well long story short: those vulnerabilities are still unpatched to this day and I am kind of bored, so&hellip; blogpost.</p>
<p>If anyone from <a href="https://twitter.com/InfoAtac">@InfoAtac</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BusCotral">@BusCotral</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/romamobilita">@romamobilita</a> happens to read this blog post, maybe, just maybe, fix them? I&rsquo;m sure your users would appreciate it.
Also, consider using a <a href="https://securitytxt.org/">security.txt</a>, or making it easier to find security contacts.</p>
<p>By the way, public disclosures are a free as in beer service, however, rewards are still appreciated :).</p>
<p>Until next time,
pop alerts.</p>

            <description>For the few souls that ever followed my blog: I finally migrated. There was no real reason to keep a wordpress blog, as I really never used any features from Wordpress.
I migrated to Github pages, because&amp;hellip; free hosting, and custom domains. Seemed nice enough to me, also for some reason I ended up using Hugo, over Jekyll. I could never get Jekyll to run even thought the setup is actually almsot the same as Hugo&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

There was no real reason to keep a <a href="https://thatsn0tmysite.wordpress.com">wordpress blog</a>, as I really never used any features from Wordpress.</p>

<p>Truth is, deep inside my brain there is a gopher lurking.</p>
<p>Well, this was only a first post, I do not really have anything else to share. As always I end up writing once or less a year.</p>
<p>Hopefully having migrated to github pages will push me to write more.</p>
<p>Before fading to radio silence again, I will leave you with a question that has been hunting me lately.
Do people really read reports from <a href="https://openbugbounty.org/">openbugbounty</a>, I reported several XSS issues since December, and they haven&rsquo;t been fixed yet, nothing exciting, just the usual suspect: <code>&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>In a few days the reports are going to be disclosed&hellip;</p>
<p>Until then, cheers!</p>
